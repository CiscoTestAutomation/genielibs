      no mac address-table learning vlan 11
      %Warning: Disabling mac address learning would cause full or partial impact
       on features which rely upon mac address learning. Most notable of them are
       Dot1x, port-security, VQPC, flexlink and private vlans. Hence it is not
       advisable to disable mac learning when these features are configured.
       Please see configuration guide for additional information.
