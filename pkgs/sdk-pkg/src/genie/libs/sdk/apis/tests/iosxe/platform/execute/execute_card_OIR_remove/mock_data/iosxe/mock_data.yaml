          WARNING: You are power cycling one or more SVL line card.
               If all SVL line cards are down, connectivity between active
               and standby switch (if present) will be lost and would also result
               in two active switches. Traffic disruption will occur, and possible
               configuration mismatch between the switches can happen.
          Proceed with removal of module? [confirm]
