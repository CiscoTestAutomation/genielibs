    Module:
        libs.conf

    Description:
        This is the library sub-component of Genie for `genie.conf`. It Configures
        topology through Python object attributes, featuring a common object structure.
        These object's structures means that they are compatible with all operating
        systems and Management Interfaces (such as CLI/Yang/REST, etc.). These
        libraries are community driven.
